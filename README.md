dsc180a Final Code Submission

In order to install mesa-geo and rtree, we have copied Johnny Lei's README file from our domain repo. Here it is:

### Install MESA
#### Install ABM package MESA with:

> pip install mesa

#### Install MESA-geo
  If you are using a Mac Machine:
    Install rtree FIRST with conda (there seems to exist a distribution issue with pip specificly to Mac):

> conda install rtree

  Install geospatial-enabled MESA extension mesa-geo with:

> pip install mesa-geo

### How to run

Open terminal, change to the directory of the code, then type in the following command 

> python run.py
